# Input-character-limit-cpp
A way to control input by limiting characters. Windows only.

Use varies on reading, but it basically relies on the gotoxy function to travel to positions back and forth, adding or removing characters from our string.

##### This was made with very little testing, so feel free to post errors as they come.
